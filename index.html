       <p>Hello to everyone who can read this basic profile about me section!
        If you decide to keep reading on, you'll find that I am 26 years old, 
        I love good food, I love working out, and I love travelling. I have a beautiful 
        wife, Michelle, and the cutest dog you'll ever see, named Charlie. 
        On the off days when I'm not just having total fun in my life, I'm learning a new 
        thing called Web Coding. It's out of my element and seems pretty ironic since majority 
        of code is about creating elements.... Any who, that's all I got for now. Check out the 
        other links for more. </p>
